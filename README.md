Two.d
=====

A 2d game development library for the D programming language!

Based on the portable Allegro library. Except Two.d is much easier to use
and is made for D (unlike Allegro which is written in C).

Usage

Two.d isn't ready yet.

Two.d has two dependencies, Allegro 5 (can be obtained from liballeg.org) and
